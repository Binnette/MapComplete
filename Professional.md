#### Making a map from different data sources

For example, one could make a map with all benches in some city, based on the benches known by OpenStreetMap. This printed map needs a clear statement that the map data is based on OpenStreetMap.
Selling these maps is permitted.

If the mapmaker notices that the benches are missing in some area and adds them on the printed map, the data on the missing benches are automatically open data too. This means that an OpenStreetMap-contributor is allowed to take the paper map and use it to add the missing benches back into OpenStreetMap.
This contributor also has the right to ask for the dataset of the missing benches, which should be provided too.

Of course, a map with only benches can be boring. The mapmaker might also decide to add in a layer with shops, possibly sourced from another geodata provider under another license.
This is permitted to, if the map clearly states that the benches are sourced from OSM (under ODBL) and the shops have a different source (eventually with an all rights reserved).

However, mixing two datasets into one undistinguishible layer might not be permitted. For example, the mapmaker migth find that OSM has excellent data on benches in one part of the city and the closed-source provider might have excellent data on benches in another part of the city, merging these datasets into one could be problematic:
the open license would require the modifications to be openly republished, whereas the all-rights-reserved license would prohibit this.


#### Gathering open data

MapComplete is an excellent way to create Open Data, also in the setting of a government.
However, the ODBL is slightly more restrictive then a public domain license giving a licensing issue.

If you have a legal requirement to republish data as _public data_, MapComplete can still be used as data gathering tool using OpenStreetMap infastructure. In this case, the contributors using your custom built theme can opt-in to publish their edits into the _public domain_ instead of using the ODbL.
