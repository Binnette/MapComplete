    static readonly intro = `<h2>Calculating tags with Javascript</h2>

<p>In some cases, it is useful to have some tags calculated based on other properties. Some useful tags are available by default (e.g. <b>lat</b>, <b>lon</b>, <b>_country</b>), as detailed above.</p>

<p>It is also possible to calculate your own tags - but this requires some javascript knowledge. </p>

Before proceeding, some warnings:

<ul>
<li> DO NOT DO THIS AS BEGINNER</li>
<li> <b>Only do this if all other techniques fail</b>. This should <i>not</i> be done to create a rendering effect, only to calculate a specific value</li>
<li> <b>THIS MIGHT BE DISABLED WITHOUT ANY NOTICE ON UNOFFICIAL THEMES</b>. As unofficial themes might be loaded from the internet, this is the equivalent of injecting arbitrary code into the client. It'll be disabled if abuse occurs.</li>
</ul>
In the layer object, add a field <b>calculatedTags</b>, e.g.:

<div class="code">
  "calculatedTags": [
    "_someKey=javascript-expression",
    "name=feat.properties.name ?? feat.properties.ref ?? feat.properties.operator",
    "_distanceCloserThen3Km=feat.distanceTo( some_lon, some_lat) < 3 ? 'yes' : 'no'" 
  ]
</div>

The above code will be executed for every feature in the layer. The feature is accessible as <b>feat</b> and is an amended geojson object:
- <b>area</b> contains the surface area (in square meters) of the object
- <b>lat</b> and <b>lon</b> contain the latitude and longitude

Some advanced functions are available on <b>feat</b> as well:
