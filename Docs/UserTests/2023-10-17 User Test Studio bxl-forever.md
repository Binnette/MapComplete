# User Test of the Studio

## Task

Create a simple layer specification using MapComplete studio with 'images' and a question. The actual _topic_ of the layer can be chosen by the participant

This participant wanted to create a layer to park escooters

## Background info

Browser: Participants machine, browser unknown (but no browser-specific bugs were encountered)
Testurl: hosted.Mapcomplete.org/studio.html
The participant has extensive OpenStreetMap-knowledge but only used MapComplete a few times, long ago.

## Surfaced issues

- [x] In presets, all options can be chosen (e.g. regex, '<', ...). However, these should be uploadable tags
- [x] The 'try it out'-button should be a 'next'-button
- [x] Entering an incorrect ID and pressing enter still takes you to the layer editor with an incorrect ID 
- [x] A name and description are obligatory to use the layer as single-layer-theme; but those error messages are unclear.
