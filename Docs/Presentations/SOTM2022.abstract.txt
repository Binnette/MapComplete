MapComplete: introduction, retrospective, projects and community
   
## Introduction

MapComplete is a simple to use OSM-map viewer and map editor. This web-based application has seen a few successful projects and makes on-the-go mapping easy and accessible.

In this talk, the MapComplete developer will talk about the vision behind mapcomplete, do a retrospective of the first two years; highlight some successful projects (which included data imports) and the impact on the OSM-community in Belgium and beyond.






# Building your own theme

## Intro

What does it take to build a successful and easy to use editor? How can phrasing, order of question, presenting filters, ... be used to prevent mapping errors?
