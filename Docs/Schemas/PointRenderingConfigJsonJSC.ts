In this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.\n\nTo demonstrate an example making a default assumption:\n\nmappings: [  {      if: \"access=\", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible      then: \"Accessible to the general public\",      hideInAnswer: true  },  {      if: \"access=yes\",      then: \"Accessible to the general public\", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM  },  {      if: \"access=no\",      then: \"Not accessible to the public\"  } ]\n\n\nFor example, for an operator, we have `operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos`, which is often abbreviated to `operator=ANB`. Then, we would add two mappings: {     if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded     then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\" }, {     if: \"operator=ANB\", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations     then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\"     hideInAnswer: true }\n\nHide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate. Keep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch\n\ne.g., for toilets: if \"wheelchair=no\", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room. For the location of the changing table, the option \"in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird\", so we write:\n\n{     \"question\": \"Where is the changing table located?\"     \"mappings\": [         {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=female\",\"then\":\"In the female restroom\"},        {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=male\",\"then\":\"In the male restroom\"},        {\"if\":\"changing_table:location=wheelchair\",\"then\":\"In the wheelchair accessible restroom\", \"hideInAnswer\": \"wheelchair=no\"},              ] }\n\nAlso have a look for the meta-tags {     if: \"operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",     then: \"Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos\",     hideInAnswer: \"_country!=be\" }"
